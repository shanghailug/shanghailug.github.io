## Hacking Thursday

### What is Hacking Thursday

Hacking Thursday (a.k.a. H4) has been developed in Taipei. Basically it is a periodically party, holding in tea bar or coffee bar like Starbuck. Members hang out in every Thursday, jabber all the things they like. Peoples are free to join. Participant should pay for its own coffee/tea. In 2010, Billy Lin came to Shanghai from Tainan, introduced it to SHLUG.

> ### Hacking Thursday 是什么？

> Hacking Thursday 是从台湾的自由软件社区诞生的一种聚会形式, 最初是由几位居住于台北地区的自由软件/开放原代码开发者所发起的，每周四晚上会于特定地点聚会，会议欢迎开发者或用户加入。2010年，台南linux社区的雨苍从台湾到上海来工作，同时也把这种聚会形式介绍给了上海Linux社区，从此上海也开始组织此类活动。
